Official repository for TGI RabbitMQ, a series of videos produced by the RabbitMQ team.

This show is inspired by [TGI Kubernetes](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/tgik) - thank you! - with a couple of important differences:

1. The last Friday of every month we ship a new episode.
1. Episodes are pre-recorded. We are on the fence regarding live streaming - while we don't rule it out, we pre-record by default.
1. And, most importantly, this show is about RabbitMQ, not Kubernetes - there will be some K8S, but the focus is RabbitMQ.

The [playlist index](playlist.md) contains a list of all content.

The [official YouTube channel can be found here](https://tgi.rabbitmq.com).
